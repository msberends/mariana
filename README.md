# Mariana theme file for RStudio (`thTheme` and `rstheme`)

A thTheme and RStudio theme from Sublime Text 3

The `thTheme` file was created directly from the [ST3 repository]([https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-files/blob/master/Packages/Color%20Scheme%20-%20Default/Mariana.sublime-color-scheme](https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-files/blob/c0015010abcaa293f457f75cf558aa42eb060933/Packages/Color%20Scheme%20-%20Default/Mariana.sublime-color-scheme)https://github.com/twolfson/sublime-files/blob/c0015010abcaa293f457f75cf558aa42eb060933/Packages/Color%20Scheme%20-%20Default/Mariana.sublime-color-scheme) on 1st of October 2023 (courtesy of Sublime HQ Pty Ltd, Dmitri Voronianski). It is a direct clone and should contain all scopes in the original ST3 file.

The `rstheme` file was created using `rstudioapi::convertTheme("mariana.thTheme", add = FALSE)` in RStudio. 

Please note that the ACE editor that RStudio uses is much less sophisticated than Sublime Text 3, meaning that not all syntax highlighting can be converted from the `thTheme` file to the `rstheme` file.
